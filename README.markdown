### ElvUI Tweaks By: Lockslap <adam@wowhead-tooltips.com>
_I recently started using [ElvUI](http://www.tukui.org/forums/forum.php?id=84 "ElvUI") for my WoW UI, and came up with ideas that would change/improve/tweak some minor features.  There are __NO__ major changes, mostly just some minor tweaks to the functionality/tooltips of the datatexts._

#### Tweaks Included
*  Wrote a new datatext to display [Recount's](http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/recount.aspx) DPS value, rather than the self-calculated one from the current DPS datatext.  The tooltip shows your personal damage and DPS, along with the raid's damage and DPS.
*  Edited all the datatexts to add what clicking them does in their tooltips, for example: `Left Click to Open Bags`.
*  Tweaked Guild datatext's tooltip to always show ranks.
*  Tweaked Friends datatext's tooltip to always show notes (Battle.Net entries only).
*  Added `/played` display to the Time datatext's tooltips.
*  Added option to always use Guild bank funds to repair.
*  Tweaked system datatext to only display the top 20 addon memory usage.
*  Tweaked bag datatext's tooltip to show the free slots status of your character's bags.  Also modified the click functionality to open keyring with right click, all bags with left click.
